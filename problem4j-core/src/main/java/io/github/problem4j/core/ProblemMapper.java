 * Converts exceptions annotated with {@link ProblemMapping} into {@link ProblemBuilder} instances,

 *
 * <p>Implementations may optionally make use of a {@link ProblemContext} to provide request- or
 * application-specific data such as trace IDs.
 *
 * <p>Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ProblemMappingProcessor processor = ...;
 * Throwable ex = new ValidationException("user-123", "email");
 * if (processor.isAnnotated(ex)) {
 *     Problem problem = processor.toBuilder(ex, context).build();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Implementations should return {@code null} if the exception class is not annotated with {@code
 * ProblemMapping}, and may throw {@link ProblemMappingException} if an error occurs during problem
 * creation.
