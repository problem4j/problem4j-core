# Releasing

1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` - change `[Unreleased]` to `[X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a new `[Unreleased]` section on top.
2. Update `version` property in `gradle.properties` to the new version.
3. Commit the changes from (1) and (2) with a message `"Release X.Y.Z"` and push to GitHub.
4. Create an annotated git tag named `vX.Y.Z` with the message `"Release X.Y.Z"` and push it to GitHub. This will
   trigger the release workflow, which will build and publish the artifacts to Sonatype repository. You can use the
   [`./tools/tagrelease`](./tools/tagrelease) script to ensure the tag is correctly formatted and prevent mistakes. See
   `./tools/tagrelease --help` for user manual of that script.
5. Update `version` property in `gradle.properties` to the next development version, for example `1.4.1-SNAPSHOT`.
6. Commit the change from (5) with a message `"Update snapshot version"` and push to GitHub.

## Maven Central

1. Keep Git tags with `vX.Y.Z-suffix` format. GitHub Actions job will only trigger on such tags and will remove `v`
   prefix.
2. The releasing procedure only uploads the artifacts to Sonatype repository. You need to manually log in to Sonatype to
   push the artifacts to Maven Central.

See [`gradle-publish-release.yml`][gradle-publish-release.yml] for publishing release versions instructions.

Set the following environment variables in your CI/CD (GitHub Actions, etc.):

```txt
# generated on Sonatype account
PUBLISHING_USERNAME=<username>
PUBLISHING_PASSWORD=<password>

# generated PGP key for signing artifacts
SIGNING_KEY=<PGP key>
SIGNING_PASSWORD=<PGP password>
```

Artifacts are published to Maven Central via Sonatype, using following Gradle task.

```bash
./gradlew -Pversion=<version> -Psign publishAllPublicationsToCentralPortal
```

This command uses `nmcp` Gradle plugin - [link](https://github.com/GradleUp/nmcp).
